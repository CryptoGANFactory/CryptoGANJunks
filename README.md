Welcome Crypto and NFT community,  
CryptoGANFactory will soon it's first NFT collection called CryptoGANJunks! In case you wonder what the hell GAN means, it stands for generative adversarial network. You still don't know what the hell we are talking about? Ok, let me explain. Generative adversarial networks enable us to generate new 'realistic' data, based on training on existing data. For example, if we train a network to understand what a Pokemon is, using a big set of existing Pokemon, it might be able to invent a new Pokemon. Our CryptoGANJunks are created by using this type of neural network trained on CryptoPunks.
But why are your NFT called 'Junks'? That's a good question! Take a look at our title pic!
